# Cattle Mounting Detection – Inference Video Results

This repository stores video-based inference results for an automatic detection system of mounting behavior in cattle using deep learning.

The main goal of this repo is to provide qualitative visual evidence of how the current mounting detection model performs on real or recorded farm videos.
